# Contributing

We're excited to see you're interested in contributing to Vapor! This document covers how you can report any issues you find or contribute with bug fixes and new features.

## Reporting Issues

Go ahead and open a new issue [on Vapor](https://github.com/vapor/vapor/issues/new), or whichever package you're experiencing the issue with. The team will be notified and we should get back to you shortly.

We give you a few sections to fill out to help us hunt down the issue more effectively. Be sure to fill everything out to help us get everything fixed up as fast as possible.

## Security Issues

If you discover a security issue with Vapor, please follow [our security procedure](https://github.com/vapor/vapor/security/policy). Please **do not** publicly report an issue until it has been fixed. We have a disclosure policy and timelines in the linked security policy.

## Pull Requests

We are always willing to accept and review pull requests for bug fixes and new features.

Bug fixes are pretty straight forward. Open up a PR and a maintainer will help guide you to make sure everything is in good order.

New features are little more complex. If you come up with an idea, you should follow these steps:

- [Open a new issue](https://github.com/vapor/vapor/issues/new), or post in the #ideas or #development channel on the [Discord server](http://vapor.team/). This lets the us know what you have in mind so we can discuss it from a higher level down to the implementation details.

- After you open a PR, make sure it covers the PR checklist:
  - CI is passing (code compiles and passes tests).
  - There are no breaking changes to public API.
  - New test cases have been added where appropriate.
  - All new code has been commented with doc blocks `///`.

If it isn't your PR that causes the CI failure, one of the maintainers can helps sort out the issue.
    
- After everything is okayed, one of the maintainers will merge the PR and tag a new release. Congratulations on your contribution!
